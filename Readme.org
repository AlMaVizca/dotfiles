* Dotfiles

This are my personal configurations, feel free to use them and suggest changes.

[[https://systemcrafters.net/managing-your-dotfiles/using-gnu-stow/][Here]] is a quick overview of how this works.
** Installation

1. Clone the repository, or download the package in `~/.dotfiles`
2. Install all the configurations using /stow/
   #+begin_src sh
     stow .
   #+end_src
   This will replicate the paths with symlinks.


** What configurations does it have?
- git - you will have to setup your user
- Ansible for socket reuse with assh
- Emacs - many things ðŸ˜†
- Npm
- Python
- Zsh + powerline
  with extra functions
- Tmux + yat.sh
