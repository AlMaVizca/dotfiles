#+TITLE: Emacs & workflow

This configurations uses [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][purcell/emacs.d: An Emacs configuration bundle
with batteries included]] as a basic layer, and I'm adding my own customizations.
[[https://github.com/purcell][Steve Purcell]] mention on his emacs repository, to make customizations on
/.emacs.d/lisp/init-locals.el/ and I have chosen to modify that file as littly as
possible.
*Note*: There is one modification required to Purcell's repo, [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d/issues/863][purcell/emacs.d#863
Relocate init-preload-local]], in order to use elpaca.
Because it's only a string relocation I've decided not to fork it. Yet if you
want to use this settings, please make the change.
In it, I'm adding a source path for my emacs configurations, and loading the
packages configurations along with org-mode settings.
Then the startup process continues loading Purcell's settings, and later
init-local.el to load my-system.el
/my-system.el/ is loading these different sections:

I'm a big fan of [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookMarks][bookmarks]], and I get to use them also with my shell -> [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookMarks#h5o-9][syncing bookmarks with zsh]]
